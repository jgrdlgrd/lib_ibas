A mortal kombat with the C language. #ZA_IBAS

To write labs the same way as *normal* people do – too boring for me.
I'd prefer doing something... described in Russian as "***бессмысленный и беспощадный***".
But it's a perfect way to plunge oneself into a new language and I have learnt really much about how the things work in С (and how they don't work).

Welcome to my delirium :) BTW, it's my first repo on GitHub.  
Any feedback is welcomed.

## What does IBAS stand for?
Don't ask me. It's kind of Russian state secret.

## Tech details
* Tested with GCC 5.4.0 on Cygwin
